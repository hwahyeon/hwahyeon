## Hi there 🦊
Software developer who enjoys working with `C` and `JavaScript`.  
Also experienced in `DevOps` and currently contributing to **open-source projects**.  

I mainly focus on web systems and automation, while staying open to a wide range of technologies and challenges, as well as interests in translation, Common Lisp, AI, and mathematics.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss new ideas.
