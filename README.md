## Hi there 🦊
Software developer who enjoys working with `C` and `JavaScript`.  
Also experienced in `DevOps` and currently contributing to **open-source projects**.  

I mainly focus on **web development**, but I also enjoy exploring translation, Common Lisp, and mathematics.  

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or discuss new ideas.
